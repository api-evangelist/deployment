Apify takes certain common patterns found in most web services and abstract them so that you can quickly write web APIs without having to write too much code.\nAPIfy aims to help organizations open up APIs to developer communities, in a fast, simple and secure way. APIs promise to help organizations drive new revenue and reach across mobile and cloud. They can also make organizations more responsive to changing customer needs by giving them the data and application access they need, when they need it.\nBut understanding best practices for opening up APIs to outside communities can be daunting.
