<p>These are the common building blocks I have pullled from my research so far.

<a href="" id="home-name-link-513" style="color: #000;"><strong>Framework</strong></a><p><p>There is no reason to hand-craft an API from scratch these days.&nbsp; There are numerous frameworks out their that are designed for rapidly deploying web APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deploying APIs using a framework is only an option when you have the necessary technical and developer talent to be able to understand the setup of environment and follow the design patterns of each framework.</p>
<p>When it comes to planning the deployment of an API using a framework, it is best to select one of the common frameworks written in the preferred language of the available developer and IT resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Frameworks can be used to deploy data APIs from CSVs and databases, content from documents or custom code resources that allow access to more complex objects.</p></p>

<a href="" id="home-name-link-515" style="color: #000;"><strong>Proxy</strong></a><p><p>API proxy are common place for taking an existing API interface, running it through an intermediary which allows for translations, transformations and other added services on top of API.</p>
<p>An API proxy does not deploy an API, but can take existing resources like SOAP, XML-RPC and transform into more common RESTful APIs with JSON formats.</p>
<p>Proxies provide other functions such as service composition, rate limiting, filtering and securing of API endpoints. API gateways are the preffered approach for the enterprise, and the companies that provide services support larger API deployments.&nbsp;</p></p>

<a href="" id="home-name-link-517" style="color: #000;"><strong>Hosting</strong></a><p><p>Hosting is all about where you are going to park your API. Usual deployments are on-premise within your company or data center, in a public cloud like Amazon Web Services or a hybrid of the two.</p>
<p>Most of the existing service providers in the space support all types of hosting, but some companies, who have the required technical talent host their own API platforms.</p>
<p>With HTTP being the transport in which modern web APIs put to use, sharing the same infrastructure as web sites, hosting APIs does not take any additional skills or resources, if you already have a web site or application hosting environment.</p></p>

<a href="" id="home-name-link-518" style="color: #000;"><strong>Versioning</strong></a><p><p>There are many different approaches to managing different version of web APIs.&nbsp; When embarking on API deployment you will have to make a decision about how each endpoint will be versioned and maintained.</p>
<p>Each API service provider offers versioning solutions, but generally it is handled within the API URI or passed as an HTTP header.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Versioning is an inevitable part of the API life-cycle and is better to be integrated by design as opposed to waiting until you are forced to make a evolution in your API interface.</p></p>

<p>Document needs to be derived from quality API designs, kept up to date and made accessible to developers via a portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several tools available for automatically generting documentation and even what is called interactive documentation, that allows for developers to make live calls against an API while exploring the documentation.</p>

<a href="" id="home-name-link-511" style="color: #000;"><strong>CSV to API</strong></a><p><p>Text files that contain comma separate values or CSVs, is one of the quickest ways to convert existing data to an API.&nbsp; Each row of a CSV can be imported and converted to a record in a database, and easily generate a RESTful interface that represents the data stored in the CSV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CSV to API can be very messy depending on the quality of the data in the CSV, but can be a quick way to breathe new life into old catalogs of data lying around on servers or even desktops.&nbsp; The easiest way to deal with CSV is to import directly into database, than generate API from database, but the process can be done at time of API creation.</p></p>

<a href="" id="home-name-link-512" style="color: #000;"><strong>Database to API</strong></a><p><p>Database to API is definitely the quickest way to generate an API. If you have valuable data, generally in 2013, it will reside in a Microsoft, MySQL, PostgreSQL or other common database platform.</p>
<p>Connecting to a database and generate a CRUD, or create, read, updated and delete API on an existing data make sense for a lot of reason.&nbsp; This is the quickest way to open up product catalogs, public directories, blogs, calendars or any other commonly stored data.</p>
<p>APIs are rapidly replace database connections, when bundled with common API management techniques, APIs can allow for much more versatile and secure access that can be made public and shared outside the firewall.</p></p>

<a href="" id="home-name-link-514" style="color: #000;"><strong>Gateway</strong></a><p><p>API gateways are enterprise quality solutions that are designed to expose API resources. Gateways are meant to provide a complete solution for exposing internal systems and connecting with external platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>API gateways are often used to proxy and mediate existing API deployments, but may also provide solutions for connecting to other internal systems like databases, FTP, messaging and other common resources.</p>
<p>Many public APIs are exposed using frameworks, most enterprise APIs are deployed via API gateways--supporting much larger ideployments.</p></p>

While I don't support scraping of content in all scenarios, and business sectors, but in the right situations scraping can provide a perfectly acceptable content or data source for deploying an API.</p></p>
