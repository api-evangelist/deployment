title: 'Building Blocks'

<p>These are some of the common building blocks I have pullled from my research into this layer of the API space.</p>

<h2>General Considerations</h2>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>Database to API</strong> - Connecting to a database and generating a CRUD, or create, read, update and delete API on an existing data source.</li>
<li><strong>Framework</strong> - Crafting and API using an existing API framework in a particular programming language, providing the HTTP scaffolding needed.</li>
<li><strong>Gateway</strong> - API gateways provide a solution for tapping into internal systems and connecting with external platforms, to expose APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Proxy</strong> - API proxy are common place for taking an existing API interface, running it through an intermediary which allows for translations, transformations and other added services on top of API.</li>
<li><strong>Connector</strong> - Contrary to an API proxy, there are API solutions that are "proxyless", while just allowing an API to connect or plugin to the advanced API resources</li>
<li><strong>Hosting</strong> - Hosting is all about where you are going to park your API. Usual deployments are on-premise within your company or data center, in a public cloud like Amazon Web Services or a hybrid of the two.</li>
<li><strong>JSON to API</strong> - Deploying an API from JSON file, providing a simple, delimited, structured data store as a file rather than database.</li>
<li><strong>Scraping</strong> - Harvesting or scraping of data from an existing website, content or data source, when an existing data source is unavailable, and then publishing as an API.</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong> - The new virtualization movement, lead by Docker is providing new ways to package up APIs, and deploy as small, modular, virtualized containers.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Provides a simple way to publish documentation, code libraries, TOS, and other common building blocks in support of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>CSV to API</strong> - Deploying an API from comma separated files, providing a simple, delimited, structured data store as a file rather than database.</li>
</ul>
