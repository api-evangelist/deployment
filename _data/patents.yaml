  name: High-level language for specifying configurations of cloud-based deployments
  summary: ""
  abstract: A high-level object-oriented specification language allows configurable
    components of a cloud-based deployment to be modeled by a class definition that
    includes a group of configurable class parameters. The object-oriented specification
    language supports extension of an existing base class definition to create new
    class definitions, and supports inheritance of class parameters from the existing
    base class definition by the new class definitions. A cloud-based deployment can
    be customized based on class definitions used in configuring one or more generic
    deployments, such as by modifying class parameter values of the class definitions,
    varying interrelationships between the classes, and supplementing existing class
    parameters with new class parameters. The high-level object-oriented specification
    language supports class definitions that model hardware and virtual resources
    as well as software roles and service roles served by software applications and
    services in a cloud-based deployment. Syntax for specifying dependency and connectivity
    between classes is also provided.

  name: Enforceable launch configurations
  summary: ""
  abstract: Users intending to launch instances or otherwise access virtual resources
    in a multi-tenant environment can specify a launch configuration. For each type
    of instance or each type of user, at least one launch configuration is created
    that includes parameters and values to be used in instantiating an instance of
    that type, the values being optimized for the current environment and type of
    instance. Launch configurations can be optimized for different types of users,
    such as to account for security credentials and access levels. Such an approach
    enables users to launch instances by contacting the resource provider directly
    without need for a proxy, which can function as a choke point under heavy load.
    The use of an appropriate launch configuration can be enforced for any type of
    user at any level, such as at the sub-net level, by modifying a request that does
    not specify an appropriate launch configuration.

  name: Device authentication within deployable computing environment
  summary: ""
  abstract: A deployable computing environment may facilitate interaction and data
    sharing between users and devices. Users, devices, and relationships between the
    users and devices may be represented within the deployable computing environment.
    A relationship between a user and a device may specify that the device is owned
    by the user and that the device is authorized to perform operations within the
    deployable computing environment on behalf of the user. Secure authentication
    of devices and users for interaction within the deployable computing environment
    is achieved by authenticating tickets corresponding to the user, the device, and
    the relationship. A device identification ticket and a user identification ticket
    are used to authenticate the device and user for interaction within the deployable
    computing environment. A device claim ticket allows the device to perform delegated
    operations (e.g., data synchronization, peer connectivity, etc.) on behalf of
    the user without the user's credentials (e.g., user identification ticket).

  name: Tag-based resource configuration control
  summary: ""
  abstract: In a system that provides network-based infrastructure services, customer
    resources are tagged in accordance with policies provided by the customers. Resources
    may be automatically tagged upon creation based on the provided policies. In addition,
    existing resources may be analyzed and automatically tagged to indicate characteristics
    of the resources that may be of interest to the customer. The customers may also
    specify configuration policies in terms of resource tags, and the system may be
    configured to apply and/or enforce the configuration policies.

  name: Approaches for deployment approval
  summary: ""
  abstract: A deployment approval system receives, from a deployment tool, a deployment
    request for performing a deployment to a particular resource. The deployment approval
    system can identify at least one rule for approving or rejecting the deployment
    request based on one or more criteria. The deployment approval system can determine
    whether the deployment request satisfies the one or more criteria in the at least
    one rule to approve or reject the request. If the deployment request is approved,
    the deployment approval system sends an approval to the deployment tool to perform
    the deployment. The deployment tool can then perform the deployment and, once
    the deployment is complete, the deployment approval system can receive a confirmation
    of the deployment. The deployment approval system can then store data describing
    the deployment in an audit repository.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Methods, systems, and computer-readable media for automating deployment
    of service applications by exposing environmental constraints in a service model
    are provided. In general, the methods are performed in the context of a general
    purpose platform configured as a server cloud to run various service applications
    distributed thereon. Accordingly, the general purpose platform may be flexibly
    configured to manage varying degrees of characteristics associated with each of
    the various service applications. Typically, these characteristics are provided
    in the service model that governs the environmental constraints under which each
    component program of the service application operates. As such, hosting environments
    are selected and adapted to satisfy the environmental constraints associated with
    each component program. Adapting the hosting environments includes installing
    parameters transformed from configuration settings of each component program via
    map constructs, thereby refining the hosting environment to support operation
    of the component program.

  abstract: The diverse objects comprising a computing environment may be represented

    (creation, reading, updating, and deleting) and more sophisticated operations
    (synchronizing, paginating, and caching), as well as with the object hierarchy
    in general. A platform may be devised to facilitate the various operations of
    the processes on the object hierarchy. The platform may be embodied, such as in
    an application runtime, and deployed to a variety of platforms to facilitate an
    equivalent execution of the processes on any type of device and consistent interactions
    with the object hierarchy.
