    III-nitride semiconductor layer over a substrate, placing a photoresist mask over
    the group III-nitride semiconductor layer, patterning a generally circular grid
    in the photoresist mask and the group III-nitride semiconductor layer, and forming
    the group III-nitride semiconductor layer into generally pointed tips using an
    inductively coupled plasma dry etching process, wherein the group III-nitride
    semiconductor layer comprises a group III-nitride semiconductor material having
    a low positive electron affinity or a even a negative electron affinity, wherein
    the inductively coupled plasma dry etching process selectively creates an anisotropic
    deep etch in the group III-nitride semiconductor layer, and wherein the inductively
    coupled plasma dry etching process creates an isotropic etch in the group III-nitride
    semiconductor layer. Preferably, the photoresist layer is approximately 1.7 microns
    in thickness, and the fabricated tips have a radius of curvature of less than
    100 nanometers.

  name: Self managing software agents with introspection
  summary: ""
  abstract: A system and method is described for managing plugin program components
    through encapsulation in a self managing agent that supports introspection for
    installation. An agent evaluator engine at the host machine interrogates the introspective
    interface for the agent to determine what resources are required by the plugin.
    In addition, the engine determines what effect the plugin will have on the host
    system, and invokes the installation logic which may be contained in the agent.
    Using the introspective mechanism and installation logic, any changes in the plugin
    (such as revisions) and the associated dependency changes can be readily accommodated
    since only a single base of information and installation logic, that which is
    contained within the enclosing agent, requires modification.

    authentication information from a processor and an authorization server uses the
    information to check authorization functionality. The authorization or access
    rights of the processor may be carried as a part of the job ticket. Using these
    features, the service center may provide trusted authentication information about
    the processor to the authorization server, and the authorization server then performs
    its authority check functions. The job ticket maybe signed with an industry standard
    public key encryption message digest (MD) signature, and may be protected by a
    public key encryption system. Hence, any entity that has the public key may validate
    the job ticket without having to communicate with the authentication server. These

  name: Methods and system suppressing clutter in a gain-block, radar-responsive tag
    system
  summary: ""
  abstract: Methods and systems reduce clutter interference in a radar-responsive
    tag system. A radar transmits a series of linear-frequency-modulated pulses and
    receives echo pulses from nearby terrain and from radar-responsive tags that may
    be in the imaged scene. Tags in the vicinity of the radar are activated by the
    radar's pulses. The tags receive and remodulate the radar pulses. Tag processing
    reverses the direction, in time, of the received waveform's linear frequency modulation.
    The tag retransmits the remodulated pulses. The radar uses a reversed-chirp de-ramp
    pulse to process the tag's echo. The invention applies to radar systems compatible
    with coherent gain-block tags. The invention provides a marked reduction in the
    strength of residual clutter echoes on each and every echo pulse received by the
    radar. SAR receiver processing effectively whitens passive-clutter signatures
    across the range dimension. Clutter suppression of approximately 14 dB is achievable
    for a typical radar system.

  name: Method and apparatus for minimizing network congestion during large payload
    delivery
  summary: ""
  abstract: Large payload files are selectively partitioned in blocks and the blocks
    distributed to a plurality of distribution stations at the edge of the network
    qualified to have the data. Each qualified station decides how much and what portion
    of the content to save locally, based on information such as network location
    and environment, usage, popularity, and other distribution criteria defined by
    the content provider. Different pieces of a large payload file may be available
    from different nodes, however, when a user requests access to the large payload
    file, for example, through an application server, a virtual file control system
    creates an illusion that the entire file is present at the connected node. However,
    since only selective portions of the large payload file may actually be resident
    at that node's storage at the time of request, a cluster of distribution servers
    at the distribution station may download the non-resident portions of the file
    as the application server is servicing the user. The download may be in parallel
    and usually from the least congested nodes. New nodes added to the network learn
    from other nodes in the network what content they should have and download the
    required content, in a desired amount, onto their local storage devices from the
    nearest and least congested nodes without interrupting network operation. Each
    node manages its local storage and decides what content to prune based on information
    such as usage patterns.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Solutions to a value recycling problem that we define herein facilitate
    implementations of computer programs that may execute as multithreaded computations
    in multiprocessor computers, as well as implementations of related shared data
    structures. Some exploitations of the techniques described herein allow non-blocking,
    shared data structures to be implemented using standard dynamic allocation mechanisms
    (such as malloc and free). Indeed, we present several exemplary realizations of
    dynamic-sized, non-blocking shared data structures that are not prevented from
    future memory reclamation by thread failures and which depend (in some implementations)
    only on widely-available hardware support for synchronization. Some exploitations
    of the techniques described herein allow non-blocking, indeed even lock-free or
    wait-free, implementations of dynamic storage allocation for shared data structures.
    A class of general solutions to value recycling is described in the context of
    an illustration we call the Repeat Offender Problem (ROP), including illustrative
    Application Program Interfaces (APIs) defined in terms of the ROP terminology.
    Furthermore, specific solutions, implementations and algorithm, including a Pass-The-Buck

  name: Methods and arrangements to manage on-chip memory to reduce memory latency
  summary: ""
  abstract: Methods, systems, and media for reducing memory latency seen by processors
    by providing a measure of control over on-chip memory (OCM) management to software
    applications, implicitly and/or explicitly, via an operating system are contemplated.
    Many embodiments allow part of the OCM to be managed by software applications
    via an application program interface (API), and part managed by hardware. Thus,
    the software applications can provide guidance regarding address ranges to maintain
    close to the processor to reduce unnecessary latencies typically encountered when
    dependent upon cache controller policies. Several embodiments utilize a memory
    internal to the processor or on a processor node so the memory block used for
    this technique is referred to as OCM.

  name: Control unit operations in a real-time collaboration server
  summary: ""
  abstract: In a real-time collaboration server, a control unit manages a collaboration
    mode. The control unit operates a virtual client that maintains a virtual screen
    reflecting the status of the collaboration (e.g., the contents of a shared desktop
    or whiteboard). The virtual client renders collaboration data within the virtual
    screen. New clients are synchronized with an ongoing collaboration by packing
    and sending them a copy of the virtual screen. The control unit maintains a queue
    of collaboration data to be sent to participating clients. Each client may have
    a pointer identifying the queued data it is processing. The queue may be collapsed
    (e.g., when it reaches a maximum size) by sending a copy of the virtual screen
    to one or more clients that have not yet consumed old data in the queue; those
    clients are then updated to skip the queue entries embodied in the virtual screen.

    to the information systems and to areas of facilities controlled by access control
    system. Each of the information systems and facility protection systems sends
    event data to the computer server when an event occurs on its respective system,
    and an event transaction processor in the computer server determines action(s),
    if any, to take in response to one or more received events and accordingly sends
    action data to other information systems and facility protection systems to instruct
    such systems to automatically respond to security risks representing by such events
    in real-time. Central management of users and their access privileges, and monitoring
    of events is further provided.

  name: Configuration profiles for output cached pages
  summary: ""
  abstract: Profiles hold cache settings externally from a requesting resource. The
    external cache settings stored within a profile may be associated with one or
    more resources. This allows the external cache settings for a group of resources
    to be managed from one location rather than having to change the internal cache
    settings for each resource. When a resource is processed by the server, the external
    cache settings are obtained from a cache profile and applied to the requesting
    resource. The external cache settings may also be merged with any internal resource
    settings. As a result of merging the settings some of the external cache settings
    and/or some of the internal cache settings may be overridden.

  abstract: The present invention relates to a secure method of distributing configuration
    data for a programmable logic device (PLD). The configuration data is encrypted
    to generate encrypted configuration data. A decryption key is encrypted using
    a silicon key. The encrypted configuration data and the encrypted decryption key
    are transferred to a PLD. Within the PLD, the encrypted decryption key is decrypted
    using the silicon key. Then, also within the PLD, the encrypted configuration
    data is decrypted using the decryption key to recover the configuration data.
    The PLD is then configured using the configuration data. The silicon key may be
    communicated to the PLD by tying predetermined input pins to an active high voltage
    level or signal ground, to form a binary code.

  name: Centralized adaptive network memory engine
  summary: ""
  abstract: "There is a constant battle to break even between continuing improvements
    in DRAM capacities and the growing memory demands of large-memory high-performance
    applications. Performance of such applications degrades quickly once the system
    hits the physical memory limit and starts swapping to the local disk. We present
    the design, implementation and evaluation of Anemone\u2014an Adaptive Network
    Memory Engine\u2014that virtualizes the collective unused memory of multiple machines
    across a gigabit Ethernet LAN, without requiring any modifications to the either
    the large memory applications or the Linux kernel. We have implemented a working
    prototype of Anemone and evaluated it using real-world unmodified applications
    such as ray-tracing and large in-memory sorting. Our results with the Anemone
    prototype show that unmodified single-process applications execute 2 to 3 times
    faster and multiple concurrent processes execute 6 to 7.7 times faster, when compared
    to disk based paging. The Anemone prototype reduces page-fault latencies by a
    factor of 19.6\u2014from an average of 9.8 ms with disk based paging to 500 \u03BCs
    with Anemone. Most importantly, Anemone provides a virtualized low-latency access
    to potentially \u201Cunlimited\u201D network memory resources."

  name: Resource management of social network applications
  summary: ""
  abstract: Applications in social networks support interaction between members through
    various types of channels such as notifications, newsfeed, and so forth. For each
    channel, applications are ranked based on their user affinity measures. User affinity
    is based on measuring positive and negative interactions by users as both senders
    and recipients of messages generated by applications. Metrics are computed for
    the different types of messages and interactions provided by applications. For
    each channel, an application receives user affinity score based on specific weighted
    combination of the metrics. Applications use channel resources to send messages
    to increase their user base. Given the large number of applications that are available,
    the extent to which applications are allowed to use channels is controlled, limiting
    their resource consumption. User affinity scores of applications calculated for
    a channel are used to decide the allocation of channel resources for an application.

  name: Device authentication within deployable computing environment
  summary: ""
  abstract: A deployable computing environment may facilitate interaction and data
    sharing between users and devices. Users, devices, and relationships between the
    users and devices may be represented within the deployable computing environment.
    A relationship between a user and a device may specify that the device is owned
    by the user and that the device is authorized to perform operations within the
    deployable computing environment on behalf of the user. Secure authentication
    of devices and users for interaction within the deployable computing environment
    is achieved by authenticating tickets corresponding to the user, the device, and
    the relationship. A device identification ticket and a user identification ticket
    are used to authenticate the device and user for interaction within the deployable
    computing environment. A device claim ticket allows the device to perform delegated
    operations (e.g., data synchronization, peer connectivity, etc.) on behalf of
    the user without the user's credentials (e.g., user identification ticket).

  summary: ""
  abstract: Systems and methods for improving situational awareness on an in-trails
    procedures display. A radar system transmits a radar signal and receives and stores
    weather radar reflectivity values into a three-dimensional buffer. A processor
    determines whether any of the stored weather reflectivity values indicate the

  summary: ""
  abstract: A multi-phase process first trains a machine learned rating classifier,
    and then uses the rating classifier to automatically rate videos in a selected
    category in a way which mimics human rating. Panels of human viewers rate videos
    in tuples, and these tuples along with human preference data distilled from the
    ratings are used to create a training set that is used to train the machine learned
    rating classifier. The rating classifier becomes capable of predicting human preferences
    with regards to videos in the selected category. Optionally a second machine learned
    classifier can be trained to automatically identify videos in the selected category
    for the panels of human viewers to rate. The output of the multi-phase process
    can be used to highlight content that is predicted to be higher quality.

    component program of the service application operates. As such, hosting environments
    are selected and adapted to satisfy the environmental constraints associated with
    each component program. Adapting the hosting environments includes installing
    parameters transformed from configuration settings of each component program via
    map constructs, thereby refining the hosting environment to support operation

  name: API platform that includes server-executed client-based code
  summary: ""
  abstract: A technique for providing an API from a server to one of more endpoint
    devices including receiving a request for data from a endpoint device, retrieving
    one or more data resources from the data resources available within the server,
    based upon the request, manipulating the data within the retrieved data resources
    into a response optimized for the endpoint device, and transmitting the response
    to the endpoint device.

  name: Generating virtualized application programming interface (API) implementation
    from narrative API documentation
  summary: ""
  abstract: A virtualized Application Program Interface (API) implementation is generated
    based upon narrative API documentation that includes sentences that describe the
    API, by generating programming statements for the virtualized API implementation
    based upon parsing the narrative API documentation, and generating the virtualized
    API implementation based on upon the programming statements for the virtualized
    API implementation. The parsing of the narrative documentation may use a natural
    language parser and a domain-specific ontology for the API that may be obtained
    or created for the API. The virtualized API implementation may be generated using
    an API virtualizer.

  name: Self-service composed web APIs
  summary: ""
  abstract: Individual datasets are accessed using an application programming interface
    (API). Multiple APIs may be combined into a composite API that allows a user to
    access multiple datasets using a single query. The composite API may be designed
    to provide a simpler way to consume information from multiple datasets in response
    to a particular scenario or problem. The composite API may comprise multiple levels
    of intermediate APIs that call on each other to access desired datasets. A user
    may select the datasets that the composite API accesses and/or the composite API
    may require certain specific datasets. The composite API may be offered for sale
    or use by other users via a website, such as a data market.

  name: Methods and systems for supporting a rendering API using a runtime environment
  summary: ""
  abstract: A computing device can comprise an I/O interface and a processing element
    connected to the I/O interface and implementing a runtime environment. The processing
    element can implement a program component that causes the processing element to
    expose a rendering API not natively supported by the runtime environment, the
    rendering API invocable by code comprised in a markup document accessed by the
    processor over the I/O interface. The rendering API can be exposed by causing
    the runtime environment to respond to and update a proxy object that mirrors properties,
    methods, and behaviors defined by the rendering API.
