  summary: ""
  abstract: 'A distributed computing system conforms to a multi-level, hierarchical
    organizational model. One or more control nodes provide for the efficient and
    automated allocation and management of computing functions and resources within
    the distributed computing system in accordance with the organization model. The
    model includes four distinct levels: fabric, domains, tiers and nodes that provide
    for the logical abstraction and containment of the physical components as well
    as system and service application software of the enterprise. A user, such as
    a system administrator, interacts with the control nodes to logically define the
    hierarchical organization of distributed computing system. The control node includes
    an automation subsystem having one or more rule engines that provide autonomic
    control of the application nodes in accordance with a set of one or more rules.'

  name: High-level language for specifying configurations of cloud-based deployments
  summary: ""
  abstract: A high-level object-oriented specification language allows configurable
    components of a cloud-based deployment to be modeled by a class definition that
    includes a group of configurable class parameters. The object-oriented specification
    language supports extension of an existing base class definition to create new
    class definitions, and supports inheritance of class parameters from the existing
    base class definition by the new class definitions. A cloud-based deployment can
    be customized based on class definitions used in configuring one or more generic
    deployments, such as by modifying class parameter values of the class definitions,
    varying interrelationships between the classes, and supplementing existing class
    parameters with new class parameters. The high-level object-oriented specification
    language supports class definitions that model hardware and virtual resources
    as well as software roles and service roles served by software applications and
    services in a cloud-based deployment. Syntax for specifying dependency and connectivity
    between classes is also provided.

  name: Enforceable launch configurations
  summary: ""
  abstract: Users intending to launch instances or otherwise access virtual resources
    in a multi-tenant environment can specify a launch configuration. For each type
    of instance or each type of user, at least one launch configuration is created
    that includes parameters and values to be used in instantiating an instance of
    that type, the values being optimized for the current environment and type of
    instance. Launch configurations can be optimized for different types of users,
    such as to account for security credentials and access levels. Such an approach
    enables users to launch instances by contacting the resource provider directly
    without need for a proxy, which can function as a choke point under heavy load.
    The use of an appropriate launch configuration can be enforced for any type of
    user at any level, such as at the sub-net level, by modifying a request that does
    not specify an appropriate launch configuration.

    or overly sufficient to satisfy the future workload level. Actions may comprise
    resource provisioning, resource tuning and/or admission control.
