description: Sheetlabs turn spreadsheets into well-documented APIs, quickly and easily.
  Many businesses still share product lists, service coverage areas, or other tabular
  information with one another using spreadsheets attached to email. There are so
  many things that can go wrong with this. Sheetlabs was built with the goal of making
  it really easy for businesses to build APIs on top of their spreadsheets.
