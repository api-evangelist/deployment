description: Fluidinfo are the makers of FluidDB, an online u201ccloudu201d database.
  Using a flexible underlying representation of information and a new model of control,
  FluidDB allows users and applications to work with information more naturally. That
  includes dynamically organizing, sharing, combining and augmenting information,
  and searching in ways that have previously not been possible. It also allows users
  to choose exactly which information to share with whom, with separate controls for
  reading and writing. FluidDB lets data be social.
