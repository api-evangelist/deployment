  Nodal is a web server for Node.js, optimized for building API services quickly and efficiently. Boasting its own opinionated, explicit, idiomatic and highly-extensible framework, Nodal takes care of all of the hard decisions for you and your team. This allows you to focus on creating an effective product in a short timespan while minimizing technical debt. Nodal projects are ready to deploy to Heroku right out of the box, so you can have your website live in no time.
