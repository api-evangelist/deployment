description: 'We started Magnetic.io because we were fed up with the way online systems
  are built in the typical enterprise. Enterprises are held hostage by long and slow
  development projects that result in high risk, big-bang releases. This kills innovation
  and stifles change. It is our mission to change this: Magnetic.io is dedicated to
  developing solutions that enable and stimulate innovation and change, while reducing
  risk and cost.'
