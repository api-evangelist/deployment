<p> We’ve just made a significant change to the login experience on Orchestrate.As of today, we are implementing our own email/password authentication system and phasing out Mozilla’s Persona.The next time you login, you’ll be required to set a password.Why we’re making the switch 
When we were first building Orchestrate, we started with Mozilla’s Persona because it enabled us to focus on core features of our product, and not spend a lot of time building login, password management, etc.Persona was also desirable because it provided simple integration with Google Apps and a few other identity providers.</p>
