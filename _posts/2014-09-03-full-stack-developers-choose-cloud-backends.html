<p>The challenge before 17 Portlanders was not only to become full stack developers in four months, but to do so by giving up two beautiful summer nights per week.The Portland Code School had its “Showcase Showoff,” where teams from the class stood at tables and talked about their capstone projects.In a sign of these cloud-focused times, all five teams built their applications on top of Orchestrate, hosted in Heroku.The “full stack” does not include maintaining web or database servers, it seems.This won’t be a surprise to anyone who watched development change the last half decade.</p>
