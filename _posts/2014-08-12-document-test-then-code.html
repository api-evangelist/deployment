<p>At PyCon Canada 2013 I had the pleasure of seeing Kenneth Reitz, author of Python Requests.Kenneth described how he writes readmes before coding.By starting out answering what the project does, how, and why, you give the rest of your work a clear vision.This enables you to focus on building features your project needs, and crafting interfaces that prioritize how people will use it.Unlike Kenneth, though, I write tests before implementing a projectâ€™s guts.</p>
