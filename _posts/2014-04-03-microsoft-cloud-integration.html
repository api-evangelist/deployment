<p>Stefan Reid from Forrester Research recently put out a report on cloud integration called “The Forrester Wave: Hybrid Integration, Q1 2014”.I was happy to see that Microsoft was well represented, and that they did well.Microsoft’s key product contributions were Windows Azure BizTalk Services and Windows Azure Service Bus.Reid talks about the growing need for Cloud Based Integration and iPaaS due to the growing adoption of SaaS applications coupled with traditional and existing on premise applications and data.Microsoft came out as Leaders in Wide Integration, Deep Integration, and Cloud Integration, and for good reason.</p>
