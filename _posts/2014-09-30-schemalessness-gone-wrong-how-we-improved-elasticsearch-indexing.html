<p>Gather round the campfire, children.I want to tell you a little story about Elasticsearch.It’s a story of heartache and pain, as all good old stories are, and a lesson for the ages about the perils of schemalessness gone wrong.In the end, I’ll tell you how Orchestrate righted these wrongs once and for all, but first let me take you back to bygone days, back before we got ourselves into this mess.Back before Elasticsearch, we built search engines directly on Lucene.</p>
