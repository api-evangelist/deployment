<p>One of the neat features of the Axway API Gateway is the ability to deploy it in a multi-homed environment, so that it is associated with multiple IP addresses.The requirement is for a single API Gateway to listen on multiple IP Addresses, on the same port (usually the SSL port: port 443).This is often done because an organization wishes to deploy API Gateways virtually in multiple places on the network, while using the same server to run the API Gateways.To do this, the first step is to associate the multiple IP Addresses with the machine running the API Gateway.In this example, we associate two IP Addresses (with two corresponding subnets): 192.</p>
