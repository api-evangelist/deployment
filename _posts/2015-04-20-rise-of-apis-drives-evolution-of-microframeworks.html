<p>Its a great time to be a developer, and one of the reasons is that there are a ton of frameworks that developers can use to build apps.From Ruby on Rails and Django to Angular.js and Ember, developers have more options that ever for developing both on the server and client.The advantages to using a framework can be significant.In addition to helping developers adhere to key design principles, such as separation of concerns, and providing key tooling, modern frameworks tend to eliminate the need to reinvent the wheel, substantially reducing the time it takes developers to build apps capable of delivering high value.</p>
