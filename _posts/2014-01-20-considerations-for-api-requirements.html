<p>I’m a product management guy so requirements get me all excited.  I’m also an API guy, so when we put together APIs and requirements, well then, I’m in hog heaven.  That said I do want to try and make sure that we’re all on the same page when it comes to understanding how APIs can help and hinder with meeting the various different types of requirements we need to consider.Table above duplicated from an excellent presentation on meeting NFRs in Agile Development from Mario Cardinal.I think APIs actually introduce a third class of implementation specific requirements (“the way” the system does it).</p>
