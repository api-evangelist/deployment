<p>Not quite around the corner, perhaps, but one thing is for sure: web API technology definitely needs to evolve, and we’ve got an idea on how it might be done.We have been working on a web API framework quite different from the rest.For those of you who want to jump right in, we’re happy to announce that it is open source and the  code is available on GitHub.Most API frameworks are in the business of building interfaces, and many offer a great set of tools to do so.However, we believe that the interface is a means, not an end.</p>
