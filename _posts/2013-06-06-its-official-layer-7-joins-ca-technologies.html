<p>This week, CA Technologies officially closed its acquisition of Layer 7.As a Layer 7 co-founder, this represents the culmination of a decade’s worth of hard work.Equally important, it represents the opening of a new chapter for the company and an opportunity to amplify the vision we have been promoting.Since our founding, we have preached the vision that enterprises can open their data and application assets programmatically in a secure way.When we started off, the primary driver for opening up was tighter business integration with partners.</p>
