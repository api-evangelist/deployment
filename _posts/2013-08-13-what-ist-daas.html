<p>We live in the age of Big Data but Big Data is not showing up to the party alone.Fast data and open data are also coming along for the ride.This is why we need an “as-a-service” approach to data sharing.In a recent article for Big Data Republic, I explored the concept of data-as-a-service (DaaS) and some of the operational challenges associated with providing access to Big Data.The fact that these challenges are not just theoretical considerations was driven home to me by one of our customers, who told me that he simply didn’t have enough IT cycles to keep writing and rewriting all those queries and APIs his customers were asking for.</p>
