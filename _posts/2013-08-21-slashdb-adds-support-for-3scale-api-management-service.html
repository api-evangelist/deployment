<p>With /db‘s capability to generate API on the Fly™ directly from databases this level integration creates the most powerful combo to quickly and reliably launch, manage and safeguard REST/HTTP APIs. API metering, billing and developer portal management are only some of the features that 3Scale’s platform provides.But an API management service cannot build an API for you – that is what SlashDB does.In the past this kind of integration required manual modifications to proxy configuration files, which although powerful can be cumbersome to do.Now, all that is required is to use 3Scale web-based GUI for proxy configuration to generate required files, which then can be simply uploaded to SlashDB.</p>
