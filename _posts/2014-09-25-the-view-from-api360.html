<p>It was my great pleasure to join our inaugural #api360 event in Washington, DC, Sept 12.  The Newseum was an ideal venue, offering a stunning cityscape view including the Capitol building and, of course, the Canadian Embassy.  The day kicked off with Gray Brooks of 18F giving an insider’s view of the widespread API activities taking place in the US Federal government.  I was amazed at how much activity there is, but even more so by how refreshing their approach is.Next up, Irakli Nadareishvili from the API Academy gave insight into how APIs can be used as the best products a company or organization can have.</p>
