<p>The role of the business developer has traditionally been to initiate partnerships and follow through by ensuring some sort of integration is implemented.  As enterprises become more software-driven, integration itself increasingly comes through APIs.  This may mean that the implementation of API-driven “partner portals” is replacing traditional business development practices.  A recent article from Wired claimed that 70% of all jobs will be replaced by robots by the end of this century.Are APIs and partner portals the robots that will replace manual business development processes?</p>
