<p>Although Microsoft is best known for their Windows platform, their foray into cloud computing has shaken up the industry a bit by providing system administrators with additional contender to build their applications around.While knowing how to utilize cloud based monitoring systems within your infrastructure is an essential skill for any system administrator, when you use Microsoft Azure, there are specific best practices you can take to ensure you are getting the most from those platforms.By using load testing tools such as Visual Studio and Apache JMeter, system administrators can run controlled tests on applications to ensure that they are built to handle various scenarios the business might encounter.For example, a news site might simulate significant bursts of traffic due to covering a breaking news story while an online store could use load testing to prepare for a holiday rush or massive sale.Regardless of your industry, being able to perform controlled tests on your applications is vital to your success to ensure that you can anticipate problems before they get out of hand, rather than trying to put out fires after the fact.</p>
