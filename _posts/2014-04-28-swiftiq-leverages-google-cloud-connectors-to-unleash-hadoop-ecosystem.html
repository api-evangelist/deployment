<p>At SwiftIQ, w e unify and analyze vast amounts of disparate data and apply scalable algorithms to extract insights for our customers, enabling smarter, real-time decisions.For instance, we help lots of supermarkets collect and analyze customer transaction data to predict in-store shopper engagement, which helps retailers plan floor layouts, optimize promotions and recommend product upsells to their customers.Historically, most supermarkets could not even store detailed in-store basket information because of the size of this data.One of our more data intensive algorithms, frequent pattern mining (FPM), is intended to analyze order combinations and return the top occurrences.For a supermarket with 50,000 items typically available in store, the FPM algorithm commonly creates a million rows of unique order combinations.</p>
