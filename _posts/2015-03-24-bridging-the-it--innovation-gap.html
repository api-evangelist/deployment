<p>No IT environment springs fully formed from the pages of Information Week.Companies make critical purchases – and inherit older systems – on a continuous basis.The key to institutionalizing agility and maximizing value lies in always leveraging assets to serve key business objectives.Keep an open mind
Just because a system, solution or process has been in place for a while – maybe a long while – does not necessarily mean that it needs to be dismissed and replaced.And just because a piece of technology is brand new doesn’t mean that it won’t live up to its hype.</p>
