<p>Current web development trends are in favour of AngularJS.The framework is having its momentum and is one of the most popular choices for client side development frameworks.Â Personally, I like it a lot, it makes my job easier to jump start the web development projects quickly.It is also useful for hybrid mobile applications.Another thing that has quite a momentum for some time now is implementation and consumption of REST services.</p>
