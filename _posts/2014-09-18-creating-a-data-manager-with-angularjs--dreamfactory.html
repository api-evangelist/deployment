Many people need an app just to perform CRUD on data.Usually they resort to using one of the many Grid or Table plugins that exist such as JTables or ngGrid.I’ve found that while these are valid solutions they generally lack the ability to enforce business rules on data entry, sometimes require additional plugins, and/or require specific formatting of data to populate the UI.The dfTable component for AngularJS attempts to be an easy to implement solution that plugs right into your AngularJS app and can work with your data right out of the box.We’ll be building a data manager much like the one you can find in the admin app for the DreamFactory Services Platform.</p>
