As APIs have experienced ubiquitous adoption across IT and business, the opportunities for innovation and new business use cases are limitless. So many creative new business models have emerged from new uses of APIs that we’ve collectively coined the term “API Economy” to describe what’s happening. APIs are here to stay.They are easy to use, can be easily self-provisioned by developers without “parental guidance,” and can be monetized and licensed by the API provider – a win-win situation for both.The model mostly works, except when the hustle to publish an API or roll out the first App leads one to neglect thinking about the ramifications of being hacked.</p>
