<p>New startup  Httphub  is bucking the enterprise trend by providing a simple consumer BaaS platform that makes it possible for developers to set up and implement an API backend for their applications quickly and easily.Using Httphub, developers can build backends for their applications without the need for SDKs, libraries, control panels, or special syntax.Backend as a Service (BaaS), also referred to as Mobile Backend as a Service (mBaaS), is a relatively new category of the API space.The term was originally coined back in May 2011 by Sravish Sridhar, Kinvey founder and CEO, and refers to a model that provides developers an easy way to set up and manage a cloud-based backend for their web and mobile applications.There are basically two types of Backend as a Service providers; consumer and enterprise.</p>
