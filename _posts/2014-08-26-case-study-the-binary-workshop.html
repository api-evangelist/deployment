<p>Â The Binary Workshop is a technology agency in Chennai, India that offers consulting, training, and management services for cloud-based solutions.With expertise in product development and project management, particularly with startup companies, the firm recently shifted its focus to building its own software platform for managing startup coworking spaces, called TheWorks@pp.The need for the platform arose from requirements to manage their own coworking initiative in India, TheWorks@ (http://theworks.at).TheWorks@pp software platform aims to automate most, if not all, parts of managing and using coworking spaces by serving two distinct needs: i) provide a web-based administration console for managers of one or more coworking spaces, and ii) provide a constellation of self-service mobile applications for users who wish to visit and use these coworking spaces.</p>
