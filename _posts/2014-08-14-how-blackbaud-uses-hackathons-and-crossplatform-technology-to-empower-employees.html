<p>Last week, I was fortunate enough to be on-site when Blackbaud, one of our customers using the Appcelerator Platform, hosted its fifth “Off-The-Grid” Hackathon.Twice a year, Blackbaud invites their in-house developers to spend 24 hours exploring and bringing to life new ideas for the product and company.It’s a successful program, which often leads to innovations that wind up directly in the company’s product roadmap.Blackbaud creates software and services for nonprofits, and the event to date has been focused on improving their core offerings.That theme remains, but for this event Blackbaud introduced one big, new rule: You can build anything you want, but only those with a mobile solution are qualified to win the contest.</p>
