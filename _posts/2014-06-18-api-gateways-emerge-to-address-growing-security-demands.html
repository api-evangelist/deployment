<p>What do smartphone apps, cloud services and todays newest automobiles have in common?They all utilize application programming interfaces to share data with other Internet-connected devices, a trend that has led to the creation of thousands of new APIs in recent years.However, application programming interface (API) security experts warn that security is often an afterthought for API developers, meaning those APIs may be likely to leak sensitive data or serve as a tempting target for attackers.To that end, some believe API gateway security appliances are increasingly a must-have proposition for enterprises.API growth creates opportunities, vulnerabilities  
To get a grasp on the runaway growth of APIs, one needs only to look at statistics from ProgrammableWeb, which has been tracking publically exposed APIs since 2005.</p>
