<p>Having grown up in Ireland, I learned early on that its not a good idea to get into religious arguments.But, it also means that I know a religious argument when I see one.Surely the world of APIs is immune from religious schisms?Well, no.Recently Mike Schinkel has put his finger on something that Ive often felt: that the concept of RESTfulness in Web APIs has a religious tenor that is beyond what I’ve observed elsewhere.</p>
