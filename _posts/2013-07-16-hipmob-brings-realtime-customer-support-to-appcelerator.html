<p>The following guest post is from Ayo Omojola and the team at Hipmob.Learn more about how to use their Appcelerator module (now available for iOS as well as Android) and provide live support or peer-to-peer chat for your users directly in your app.We launched Hipmob a year ago to solve our own problems.At the time, we were running Wanderplayer and Flypad, two mobile gaming apps that turned your iPhone into a game controller for browser/desktop games, played over wifi.After building Hipmob we talked to some of our developer friends who wanted something similar, so we decided to turn it into a full fledged service.</p>
