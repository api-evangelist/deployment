<p>Im writing this from Sydney Airport, having just rounded out our seven-city Axway API Workshop tour of Australia and New Zealand, and gearing up for the worlds longest commercial flight (Sydney to Dallas).If there was any doubt that APIs are a global phenomenon, just take a look at the attendances the Axway API Workshops over the past 10 days.At Wellington yesterday we had to commandeer a breakout room because of the large audience, who were treated to Ben Kepes and an API case study from the New Zealand Customs Service.In Melbourne I watched the excellent presentations from ANZ Bank and Infosys from the standing room only area, seeing many nodding heads and ipad note-takers in front of me.Here is Peter Jarman from Infosys explaining Why an API Gateway:
  This tour makes me cast my mind back to last month, when I spoke with Mark Boyd (an Aussie in Barcelona) about the global nature of APIs.</p>
