<p>For close to five years, Intel has had a stake in the API space.All the while, Iâ€™ve often asked myself why.Intel originally acquired an API Gateway from a prior Intel Capital investment that never fully blossomed.And despite the oddness of having a tiny enterprise software franchise lost inside a semiconductor behemoth, Intel persisted in its experiment, even in the face of questionable market success and lukewarm analyst reaction.So, why double down on APIs now?</p>
