<p>I’ve been working with Orchestrate the past few weeks to help create an official ruby client for their Rest API.Based on a library put together by Orchestrate customer James Carrasquer, I’ve been working to give the library a solid foundation and recently published the first two releases of the official ruby gem.Let’s kick the tires.Let’s create a client: 
require orchestrate    client = Orchestrate :: Client.new ( your api key )  
You can verify everything is setup correctly with the ping method: 
client.</p>
