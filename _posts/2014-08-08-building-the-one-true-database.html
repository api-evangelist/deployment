<p>Every database optimizes for different assumptions and situations.No single database will handle everything your app’s data needs, no matter how much database advocates want you to believe that.Mature applications use numerous databases for all the different things they need to do, from caching to logging to searching to reporting to graphing, and so on.Comparing databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL on the basis of performance miss the point that, categorically, those databases aren’t built for speed.Redis is built for speed.</p>
