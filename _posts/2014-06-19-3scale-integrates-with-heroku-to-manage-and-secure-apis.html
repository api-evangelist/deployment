<p>We have genuine focus on providing faster and easier ways to help API providers get to market and engage with their audiences.San Francisco, CA (PRWEB) June 19, 2014 In its continuing efforts to ease the process of launching and operating an API, 3SCALE today announced the availability of the 3SCALE Heroku add-on to manage and secure APIs.Hosting APIs in a platform-as-a-service like Heroku is popular since it eliminates many infrastructure administration tasks and allows focus to remain on development.It is also an effective way to launch an API when it is unclear what the usage will be since Heroku can handle scaling your application server dynamically.In these cases, the 3SCALE add-on can easily be added to secure and manage APIs directly from the Heroku dashboard.</p>
