<p>Layer 7’s series of free eBooks continued recently with our take on the 5 Pillars of API Management.This eBook – which has been getting some great feedback – covers the what, why and how of core API Management concepts like API exposure, security, access control, lifecycle management and developer engagement.Our goal is to provide a high-level overview of each category with some key takeaways; deeper information is available from a link in each section.These resources have been distilled down from years of work in the field with customers seeking to securely expose data and applications to partners, cloud services or mobile devices.The process begins with API exposure but very few of our customers are starting from scratch – they have existing data residing in SOAP services or trapped in legacy systems.</p>
