<p>TaffyDB is a Pure-JavaScript database abstraction that stores data in JSON format.This means that you feed a JSON file to TaffyDB and you automatically get a set of methods to execute against this data, such as INSERT, DELETE, GET (SELECT) and even JOIN!The TaffyDB library was written by Ian Smith to be used on the Web and Node.js.Then Titanim Titan Ben Bahrenburg modified it to work with Titanium and Dan Tamas did some additional hackery on top of Ben’s work.</p>
