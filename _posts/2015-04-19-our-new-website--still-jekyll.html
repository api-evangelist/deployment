<p>We recently redesigned our website from the ground up.While the look and organization changed, the underlying technologies have not.We are still using Jekyll to power the site, just as we’ve done since 2011.Jekyll has come a long way and we’re taking full advantage of some of its new features.Collections are the Jekyll way to separate content types.</p>
