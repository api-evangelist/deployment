<p>Implementing a Financial Stock Watch List may seem pretty straightforward at first, but optimizing it for mobile in the most efficient way possible presents a few challenges.Today, Iâ€™d like to walk you through how you can use the Appcelerator Mobile Platform to streamline API calls and data over the wire for your mobile applications leveraging remote data sources.Appcelerator Custom Cloud Service (Node.ACS) allows Node.js based custom services to be published into the cloud and can be used to create a middleware tier to expose mobile-optimized web services to your application.</p>
