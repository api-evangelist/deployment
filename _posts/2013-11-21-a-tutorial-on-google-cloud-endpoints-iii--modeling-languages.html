<p>This post finishes with the tutorial about introducing Google Cloud Endpoints.As explained in the previous two parts, we plan to teach you how to construct a simple web backend storing data about posts and then expose it by means of a public REST-based API.We explained in the first post of the tutorial how to set up the environment.Then, we detailed how to create the core application with the endpoints to deal with posts objects.Finally, in this third post in the series we will explain how to interact with our application.</p>
