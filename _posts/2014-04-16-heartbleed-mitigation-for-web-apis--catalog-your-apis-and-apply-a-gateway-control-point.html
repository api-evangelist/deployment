<p>He goes on to talk about how an inventory of the APIs you use (internal and external) is vital, writing You need to know the services are you using, the services are you providing, who is using them, what you and the other party need to do to protect yourselves and whether it has been done.Â 
 I couldnt agree more.The first step to managing your APIs is to catalog them.Ive written before about the importance of the API Catalog, both for consumers (in an API Developer Portal) and also for administrators to keep track of the APIs which they are managing.With Axway, the API Catalog itself is available as a Web API (using JSON), which can be customized.</p>
