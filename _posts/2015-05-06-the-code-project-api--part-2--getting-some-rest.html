<p>Welcome to this, the second article in a series in which we build up a wrapper for the CodeProject API.In the first article, we started off developing a Portable Class Library implementation that would allow us to develop applications that use the API that run on a variety of platforms, without having to worry about the actual implementation details of the API.To that end, we developed an implementation that retrieves an authorization token from CodeProject.This token is going to be used in conjunction with the other API calls that we are going to make, so it seemed to be a very good place to start.In the first article, we split out the interface definition from the actual API implementation.</p>
