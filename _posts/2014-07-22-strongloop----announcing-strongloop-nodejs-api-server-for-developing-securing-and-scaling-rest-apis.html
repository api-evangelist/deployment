<p>SAN MATEO, California – July 22, 2014 – StrongLoop, the leading provider of solutions for Node.js, today announced the immediate availability of the StrongLoop API Server which makes it easy for developers to rapidly develop, deploy, secure and scale REST APIs written in Node.The ubiquity of mobile devices along with the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving a huge need for APIs that can connect devices to new and legacy data.Node has emerged as the technology of choice for creating these APIs because of its asynchronous design and the ability for developers to rapidly code using their existing skillset in JavaScript.Node’s development speed has been embraced by large companies such as PayPal, Condé Nast, Dow Jones and Yahoo.</p>
