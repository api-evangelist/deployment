<p>The beginning of a new year is a great time to reflect back on the year that was and look ahead to the year that will be.Because 2013 was such an impressive year for API technology, I thought now would be a great time to assemble a panel of API experts and talk about The Past, Present & Future of APIs.This will be our first API Tech Talk of 2014 and it’ll be a great chance for our audience to interact with the panel, ask questions, make comments and ultimately learn and think about the future of APIs.At Layer 7, we’re proud to have thought leaders and top industry talent when it comes to API design, API security, the API economy and IoT.On the panel will be members of our API Academy: VP Client Services Matt McLarty; Principal API Architect, North America Mike Amundsen; Principal API Architect, Europe Ronnie Mitra; Product Architect Holger Reinhardt; Chief Architect Francois Lascelles.</p>
