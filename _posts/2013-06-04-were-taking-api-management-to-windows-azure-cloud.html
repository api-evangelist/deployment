<p>We’re at Microsoft’s huge TechEd conference this week and in just the first few hours in can already start to be overwhelming.As one of the largest and arguably most important technology company on the planet, Microsoft touches everything having to do with everything.Mobile, cloud, enterprise, consumer, big data, scripting, platform, developers, marketers, CEOs, influencers…everything that’s important to anyone who cares about technology is represented here.So in the midst of all this, it’s notable that we’ve been inundated with questions, requests and all kinds of interest about API management.In just the first few hours, our booth (booth 2512, by the way) has been visited by some really fascinating people who are trying to extend their businesses and increase the reach of their apps through the use of APIs.</p>
