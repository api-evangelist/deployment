<p>Something has changed in the world of banking technology.Over the last few months, the architects who shape IT strategy for banks have started talking about API programs with an enthusiasm and energy that was barely at surface level in 2012.I canâ€™t put my finger on exactly what has changed but IT leaders in the financial services world are moving towards implementing API strategies as a legitimate method for supporting a wide array of business drivers.We know that connectivity and message-based integration are not new concepts for the financial industry.Enterprise architects in the banking world are masters in the art of connecting old systems with new facades and exposing backend resources through multiple channels.</p>
