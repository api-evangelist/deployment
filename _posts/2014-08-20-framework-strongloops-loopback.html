<p>Recently I did a series for New Relic on three frameworks, both for APIs and web apps.I titled it “Evaluating Node.js Frameworks: hapi.js, Restify, and Geddy” and it is available via the New Relic Blog.To check out those frameworks give that blog entry a read, then below I’ve added one more framework to the list, Strongloop’s Loopback.</p>
