<p>To say that securing the data that is communicated and transacted among applications is one of the biggest concerns for software vendors and online services is accurate, but a huge understatement.Since data is essentially the currency with which companies attract users and conduct business, there is no room for it to be compromised.A single breach of trust between company and customer (or partner, supplier or any other participant in the ecosystem) will result in a dramatic reduction in credibility.Considering how quickly and easily people can change the providers they work with, this could have draconian repercussions on any organization.Consider recent security breaches that have made headlines, put businesses in jeopardy, and created global security risks: the NSA spying case,  WikiLeaks, Snapchat’s customer phone number breach; these are just a few of the major issues that have happened recently.</p>
