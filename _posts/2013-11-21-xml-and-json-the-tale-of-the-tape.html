<p>School of Data is re-publishing Noah Veltmanâ€˜s Learning Lunches, a series of tutorials that demystify technical subjects relevant to the data journalism newsroom.This Learning Lunch is about XML and JSON, two popular machine-readable data formats that are commonly used by web APIs, described in the previous Learning Lunch.Almost every popular web API returns data in one of two formats: XML or JSON.These formats can be very confusing.They look very different from how you are probably used to thinking of data.</p>
