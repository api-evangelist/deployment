<p>luiy s curator insight,				 											 							Today, 11:21 AM 						 									 					 			 														 					                            						In an effort to help Open Data projects flourish, recently a small team of open data developers created an open, free, international directory.As of June 2013, the Open Data Directoryshowcases organizations in at least 8 countries from over 25 organizations who are publishing Open Data on the Web using a Linked Data approach.  The Directory includes 46 products and 20 organizations providing Open Data services.  There are hundreds if not thousands of additional projects using Open Data and in due course we hope they’ll add a directory listing to their organizations and projects.How does it work?</p>
