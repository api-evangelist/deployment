<p>We have been hearing from first-time users of the Open Source Restlet Framework that it was not always easy to figure out what to download when you were new to the concept of REST API development.And indeed, Restlet Framework comes in 5 editions, it can be installed locally through a Zip download, you can configure Maven to automatically refresh your dependencies, do the same with Eclipse.Add to this the different versions that any open source project provides (stable, unstable, prior versions)… for first-timers, it wasn’t necessarily simple to know where to start.Therefore, we have redesigned the Downloads section of Restlet Framework.The new pages feature a sleek design, consistent with the rest of the Restlet site, which makes it obvious for first-timers what to get (the Java SE Zip file of the current version) but still makes it easy for others, or experts, to find the other editions and versions.</p>
