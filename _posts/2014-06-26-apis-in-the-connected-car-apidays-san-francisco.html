<p>Today, Iâ€™m going to share some rather opinionated thoughts about APIs and the connected car.My opinions on this subject sprang from a combination of real-world experience plus (informed) speculation and came together as I prepared a talk for APIdays San Francisco.The connected car is widely recognized as a game changer for the automotive industry.Experts all agree that just selling cars is a thing of the past.Mobility, connectivity and in-car user-experience will be leading decision considerations for car sales.</p>
