<p>When I want to play around with an API, I usually toss a couple example calls from the command line as an initial test.The go-to application for command line HTTP calls has long been cURL.Our own API reference defaults to sample calls with cURL, which works fine for copy-paste.But I find myself forgetting command line tags, retreating to the man page and defeating the purpose of making a quick call.As handy as cURL is, I was pleased to discover HTTPie, a cURL replacement that is particularly well-suited to JSON-based REST APIs.</p>
