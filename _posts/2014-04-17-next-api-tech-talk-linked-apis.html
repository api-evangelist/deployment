<p>The challenges faced by today’s software architects go far beyond the familiar.“Big Data” means more than managing petabytes of data – it requires dealing with data-sets that span organizational boundaries.Likewise, the term “distributed system” no longer refers to just a multi-tier architecture or cloud deployment – it usually involves the connection of non-heterogeneous systems across multiple organizations.On Thursday April 24, I’ll discuss these challenges as part of Layer 7’s latest API Tech Talk.I’ll be using this opportunity to explore how architects can leverage “linked APIs” to handle Big Data sets and distributed systems that cross organizational, technological and cultural boundaries, breaking through data silos in order to better integrate information.</p>
