<p>On May 9, 2013 the White House released an executive order with the title Making Open & Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information.My favorite line in the entire document is:
 “Government information shall be managed as an asset throughout its life cycle to promote interoperability and openness, and, wherever possible and legally permissible, to ensure that data are released to the public in ways that make the data easy to find, accessible, and usable” (emphasis mine).No Dumping
 The usual approach to this type of work is to simply publish raw data in a directory or repository and then create some fencing around the data that helps track usage and distribution.Essentially, making government data “open” becomes a data dumping operation.This practice fails on all of President Obama’s three key points.</p>
