<p>It’s that time of year again!REST Fest 2013 is less than two months away (September 19-21) and preparations and are in full swing.Now in its fourth year, REST Fest has become one of my favorite events on the calendar and I’m very much looking forward to being involved with this year’s event.This year the keynote will be delivered by Brian Sletten.And – judging from the title (and my knowledge of Brian’s experience and knowledge) – it will be a great talk.</p>
