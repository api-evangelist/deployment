<p>When creating an application programming interface (API) for a service, one of the key decisions any program or product manager will face is how best to meet the needs of their prime target audience: developers.Faced with this decision, you want to make sure your API is easy to use and doesn’t represent a high barrier to entry for your specific developer audience.Currently, the typical approach is to design an interface that leverages the most common protocol on the Web today: HTTP.This is often labeled a “RESTful” API (referring to Roy Fielding’s architectural model for the World Wide Web) and offered as a one-size-fits-all (OSFA) model for developers to use when building client applications for a service.But this is not always the best approach.</p>
