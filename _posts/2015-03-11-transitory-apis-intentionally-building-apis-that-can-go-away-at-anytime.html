<p>12 Mar 2015   
I use many types of APIs.Some are public APIs, operated by other people, and then there are the APIs I have designed, operate, and consume on my own.As I design, redesign, deploy, and manage my APIs, Im in a fortunate place that I get to push the boundaries of API operations, without much of the friction of normal API platforms.Im the only one providing and consuming many of my APIs, essentially running an API dictatorship.Over time I have built quite a few APIs that are still up, active, but nobody is using them.</p>
