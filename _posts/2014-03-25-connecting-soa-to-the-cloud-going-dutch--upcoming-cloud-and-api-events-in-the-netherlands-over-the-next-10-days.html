<p>Shortly Im departing for the Netherlands for three events - hope to see you at one or more of these:Thursday 27 March: Im speaking at the API Strategy event in Amsterdam as part of the Security and Testing panel, with folks from Intel/Mashery, WS02, and Twobo. Looking forward to some good discussion on API security and API testing.Tuesday 1 April: Im speaking at the Cloud Security Alliance SecureCloud event, also in Amsterdam.My talk is on protecting your Cloud APIs from Denial-of-Service.Look like some great sessions there from Coca Cola, from telecoms providers including BT and Belgacom, and from many governments.</p>
