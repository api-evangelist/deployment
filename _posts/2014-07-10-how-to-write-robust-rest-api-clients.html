<p>After we initially released Porc, we found its interface unintuitive for the ways we used it, such that we had to resort to using Requests for a few projects for want of a better library.So today we released Porc 0.3.0, a complete rewrite of the library based on community feedback.Primarily, we flattened the interface, made asynchronous requests easier, and wrapped HTTP responses in a convenience class to make them easier to work with.</p>
