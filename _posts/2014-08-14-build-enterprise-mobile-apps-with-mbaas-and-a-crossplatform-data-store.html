<p>Anybody even tangentially involved in technology has had that moment when someone tells you their mobile app idea.Sometimes they just want you to say, “that sounds cool,” and other times they want you to build it.In either case, you may be interested in sharing with them an app builder and a datastore to persist app data.At Orchestrate, we’re teaming with Appery.io to help build cross-platform mobile applications and use our always-on, scalable data store.</p>
