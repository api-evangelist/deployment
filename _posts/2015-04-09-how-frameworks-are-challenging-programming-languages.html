<p>Technology’s constant progress has led to the point where programming languages are less divisive than they used to be as cross-compilers are getting faster and easier.These days, the progression, popularity and power of frameworks mean that many of them are becoming the building blocks of modern programming, according to Peter Wayner’s article for InfoWorld.One main concept is the adaptability of frameworks to use multiple elements.Since a lot of coding these days is linking APIs together, developers are able to leverage what others have already accomplished to build new applications far quicker and easier.Frameworks also remove the need to learn the idiosyncrasies of the language, since it is the framework that matters, not the syntax.</p>
