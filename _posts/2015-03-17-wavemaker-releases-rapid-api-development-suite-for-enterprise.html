<p>Enterprise platform-as-a-service WaveMaker today released its WaveMaker DevPortal.The new product extends the companys Rapid API Developer and Deployment platform to create an end-to-end enterprise solution for quickly spinning up APIs that can be consumed across a company’s application development.WaveMaker is confident its solution covers all stages of API management from creation to consumption by doing the following:
“One of the things we released previously was the API Designer,” CEO Samir Ghosh told ProgrammableWeb ahead of today’s launch.“Now we are releasing this DevPortal where those APIs can be shared in your organization and reused in other applications.”
The goal is to address one of the pain points when an enterprises uptake of API strategies occurs from the bottom up.</p>
