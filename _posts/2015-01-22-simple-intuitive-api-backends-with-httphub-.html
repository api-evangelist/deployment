I come across a lot of API related companies during my monitoring of the space, which I queue up, and as I have time, I work to explore and understand what they do.One company that I’ve had open in a tab for the last week is HTTPHUB.HTTPHUB is very interesting.It starts by giving you a root namespace, like https://kinlane.httphub.</p>
