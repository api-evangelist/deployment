<p>RethinkDB describes first-generation NoSQL technologies with two categories, developer-oriented and operations-oriented.Hereâ€™s what they have to say: 
Developer-oriented products include MongoDB and CouchDB.They typically pay close attention to ease of use, have rich document structure, and offer flexible querying capabilities.However, when compared with their operations-oriented counterparts, they are more difficult to deploy to sharded environments and to scale to significant load.Operations-oriented systems include Cassandra and Riak.</p>
