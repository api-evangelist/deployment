<p>This week, I had the opportunity to deliver a “lightning talk” at the APIStrat Tech Un-Workshop at Gluecon 2014.The event was focused on two key topics: IoT and service description/discovery.I was in the service track and delivered a talk called Mapping the API Landscape.I won’t cover the entire talk here (BTW, the text has lots of links to information I could not discuss on stage this week) but did want to hit some key points.What Google’s Self-Driving Car Tells Us The Google car has been in the news again and a key point that was discussed at some length in these articles was the fact that the car depends on a very detailed map of the roadways.</p>
