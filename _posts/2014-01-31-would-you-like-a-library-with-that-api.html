<p>If you are professionally inclined – like I am – to read all about the business of APIs, you may have gotten the impression that APIs are going to take over everything and bring world peace.Okay, I’m exaggerating but it is sometimes hard to remember that an API is really just a means to an end.That (business) end can vary.It might mean reaching more or different customers using mobile apps.It might mean integrating with partners.</p>
