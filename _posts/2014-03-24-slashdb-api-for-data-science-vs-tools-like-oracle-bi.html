<p>SlashDB API for Data Science vs.Tools Like Oracle BI 				  			 		     		 					
We are often asked how SlashDB compares to Oracle BI or other business intelligence software.Well, the main difference is that SlashDB provides unobstructed access to data for reading and writing, while those tools can only display data already nicely formatted for end users.In addition to that SlashDB works both internally and does not require you to send data to a third party storage to make it available on the Internet.Oracle BI generally only works on the inside, and cloud-based SaaS products generally require you to upload your data to their storage in a format that fits their systems.</p>
