<p>One of the most exciting parts of this weeks Apple Watch launch was the example of the BMW watch app.This app allows you to see the charging status of your BMWi electric car, right from your wrist.You can also check the status of the doors of your car (important information such as if they are locked or not!).Although the star of the show was the watch app, APIs had a cameo appearance, since the information shown on the watch is fetched in real-time from APIs.</p>
