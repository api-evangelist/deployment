<p>My grandfather has a bumper sticker on his pickup truck that says “He who dies with the most toys, wins.” Since my world revolves more around API Management than collecting die-cast models of John Deere tractors, I have my own version of the saying – “He who has the most context wins.” Context has always been an important part of managing data or applications, but the proliferation of enterprise B2E (business-to-employee) and B2C (business-to-consumer) mobile apps has significantly increased the need for context-based policy.The Layer 7 family of API Gateways has always been good at context.Not only does a Gateway have access to the full request and response content, it can also access header content (from a wide variety of protocols) and transaction metadata (latency, source information etc.</p>
