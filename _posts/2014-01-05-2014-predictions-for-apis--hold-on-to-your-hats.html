<p>When we made our 2013 predictions for the realm of APIs, our premise was that API adoption and use was still a relatively nascent area, but one about to explode once smart people figured out its potential.We were certainly spot-on in that regard, but few believed us when we suggested that the API Economy was about to get as vibrant as it did.It may be safe to say that 2013 was the year that APIs really caught the business world’s attention.In these past 12 months, we’ve seen major acquisitions of API enablement companies, new industry conferences dedicated to the business of APIs, and talk of API management is on the lips of leading business executives.Untold billions of dollars have been transacted, all enabled by APIs, and innovation is making the world an easier place to transact as a result of applications, mash-ups and APIs.</p>
