<p>Vincent Papaleo in Belgiums LEcho has written an article this week about the API breach discovered in Teslas API (On peut hacker une Tesla!).This is just one in a series of recent API vulnerabilities, following Snapchat and Buffer and others, but is the first to apply to an Internet of Things case.The good news is that there is a solution: Secure your API.The recommendations for protecting APIs from attack still apply: Apply API throttling and quotas, adopt a Deny by Default posture for your APIs, have full visibility of your API usage, and get alerts on anomalies.</p>
