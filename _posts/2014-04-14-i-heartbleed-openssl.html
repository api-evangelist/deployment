<p>Can the free and open source be trusted?How come the bug could stay hidden for over two years?Was it introduced intentionally?Those are some of the questions many are asking, but are those fair questions?Because the code for OpenSSL is publicly available along with its change history, anyone can track down the change to date and time it was introduced and to the individual who committed the code.</p>
