<p>On a dark and stormy night, your phone buzzes.It’s 3am, and you’re still awake.At wit’s end after your datacenter’s team told you, “We don’t know why the system is unavailable, but we’re working on it.” You tremble with helplessness as you pick up your phone and read, “The database crashed and it’s not coming back up.”
After long enough, we all have horror stories: the calls we field at awful hours, the system failures that confound us, the vendors that let you down.</p>
