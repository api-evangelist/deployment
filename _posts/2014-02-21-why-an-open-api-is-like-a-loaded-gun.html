<p>I recently participated in another of the excellent TechViews tweetchats, hosted by my friends from CA Technologies using the handle @TrendsInTech, on the topic, ‘The Risks & Rewards of API Development’.It was a great chat and you can check the full chat summary at Storify.Among other things, I was at one point inspired to tweet that “an open API is a bit like a loaded gun: Harmless ‘per se,’ but lethal in the wrong hands.” Soon after, I received an email from someone reading the chat, asking for clarification, so I thought I would jot down my thoughts here.My intent was to say that that, like a loaded gun, an open API is not necessarily bad per se but it certainly can be very dangerous if not handled correctly.</p>
