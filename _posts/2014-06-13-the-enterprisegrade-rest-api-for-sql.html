DreamFactory supports a wide variety of backend systems including SQL, NoSQL, BLOB, email, users, roles, security, and integration.But in this blog post, I wanted to focus on our support for SQL databases.The vast majority of enterprise data is stored in a SQL database somewhere, and there is a huge need to access this information for mobile application development.So DreamFactory has really focused on building a comprehensive and enterprise-grade REST API for SQL.Â 
You can install DreamFactory on any server, in the cloud or on-premises.</p>
