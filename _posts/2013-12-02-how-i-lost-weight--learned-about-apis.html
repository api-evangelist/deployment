<p>Trying to stay in shape is one of those never-ending life battles that I’ve come to expect as I get older.I’ve bounced between being a healthy shape and a not-so-healthy one for years and I’ve managed to live life just outside the edge of ideal fitness.A few months back, I reached an apex point and dedicated myself to losing a few pounds (again) and set off on a journey to change my life (yet again).Little did I know I’d learn something about APIs along the way.Everyone has their own way of losing weight but I’ve always preferred a measurable, rationalist approach: I count the calories I consume, I subtract the calories I burn and I budget accordingly.</p>
