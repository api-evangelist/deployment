<p>Yesterday in London was the big day of Axways API Workshop and Tech Lab.In the morning, we had excellent discussions led by Steve Craggs (@SteveCraggs) ofÂ Lustratus Research and Tim Haysom (@haysom_runner) of the GSMA.One of the themes was identity, in particular as related to Cloud identity and password security (or lack thereof.).We were then able to see standards such as OAuth 2.</p>
