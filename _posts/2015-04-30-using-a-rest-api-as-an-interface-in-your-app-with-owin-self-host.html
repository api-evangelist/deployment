<p>Microsoft’s ASP.NET stack has always been a powerful application framework, but it long suffered from a dependency on IIS to operate.Which was always a shame, because having an HTTP listener within a stateful application can be a very handy interface for configuration or control.For a long time, the only way you could make that happen would be to implement your own/use a 3rd party stack, or even worse, make use of the background worker that is available in ASP.NET applications.</p>
