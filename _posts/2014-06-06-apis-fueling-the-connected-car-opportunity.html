<p>I just attended the Telematics Detroit 2014 conference, which was abuzz with mobile connectivity sessions and workshops.But the mobile conversation at this event was entirely in the context of the connected car, as opposed to the mobile phone.The connected car has emerged as a real-world illustration of the opportunities presented to businesses and consumers by the Internet of Things (IoT).And – as you probably know – IoT is a hot topic right now.Thilo Koslowski, Vice President & Distinguished Analyst at Gartner, who is known for his prediction making, claimed the car will be the most innovative and exciting mobile platform over the next 10-to-15 years.</p>
