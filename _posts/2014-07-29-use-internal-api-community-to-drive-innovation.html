<p>Recently we have seen building  internal API community and providing an API catalog that others in the company can benefit from as essential to gaining true advantages for your digital channels.API development and usage is increasing in a massive way, and enterprises and consumers alike are realizing the vast reach of application functionality that is driven by APIs.Most of the prominent examples of APIs are coming from consumer apps; ecommerce and mobile capabilities are leveraging APIs to put the ability to shop, communicate and engage wherever consumers are and however they choose to interact.These consumer examples are great because they demonstrate the efficiency and simplicity with which APIs do so many things.Without much thought or effort, a mobile app user can get traffic updates, weather information, and purchase airline tickets.</p>
