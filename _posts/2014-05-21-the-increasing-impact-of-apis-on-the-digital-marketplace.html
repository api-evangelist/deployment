<p>The API can be used as a lingua franca of modern computing, allowing the enterprise to selectively open up applications in order to create value.It is not a coincidence that the API movement has grown in importance as a new generation of coders has come of age – a generation that values simplicity and getting the job done.The complexities valued by the previous generation of developers are giving way to developers more focused on lowering the barriers to entry and on improving the accessibility of information while ensuring the security of critical enterprise resources.APIs allow developers to greatly simplify integration.APIs open up new opportunities for executives to evaluate business information resources in order to build value for the enterprise by creating services that others can consume.</p>
