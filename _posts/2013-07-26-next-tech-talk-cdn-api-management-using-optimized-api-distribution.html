<p>Get ready for Layer 7’s next API Tech Talk, coming up on Wednesday July 31 at 9am PDT.This live, interactive event will feature Akamai’s Gary Ballabio alongside our very own Francois Lascelles, chatting about CDN API Management Using Optimized API Distribution.Right now, APIs are playing a central role in content providers’ efforts to maximize customer engagement by leveraging emerging online channels via cloud-based content distribution networks (CDNs).But CDNs and API publishing have raised new access management and SLA enforcement challenges for content providers.On Wednesday, Gary and Francois will explain how content providers can tackle these challenges via entitlement checks, access history and analytics.</p>
