<p>There have been numerous attempts at improving at how medical and wellness care are delivered and managed here in the United States.HealthCare.gov (aka, ObamaCare) had some initial hiccups, but is now helping millions get access to quality and affordable care.Insurance companies are making attempts to simplify services and reporting, and are participating in healthcare exchanges to provide a wider array of insurance options.On the provider side, doctors and hospital are making it easier for patient to communicate with them through web, mobile apps etc.</p>
