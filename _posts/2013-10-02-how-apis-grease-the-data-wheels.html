<p>This week, I’ve been attending and speaking at Data 2.0 in San Francisco, which is part of the API World Conference & Expo.Plainly, there is a connection between data and APIs.As an API vendor, I would dearly like to believe the universe is embracing the API; giving it the proverbial uplifted thumb.And there’s no reason to think data doesn’t similarly “like” the API.</p>
