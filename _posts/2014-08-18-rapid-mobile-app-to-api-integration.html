<p>Wireframes for user interface design are still a good idea when communicating requirements to others, however lately I would rather create them as a HTML5 prototype that is usable across heterogeneous devices with various screen sizes and resolutions.One such tool that I prefer is from Appery.io, which is a browser based jQuery and PhoneGap powered mobile application development studio.Appery.io offers a faster path to publish an application in an App Store because once the HTML5 prototyping, user acceptance testing and usability work is complete, it can also generate the Android apk and IOS binaries without the need to port to Objective C manually.</p>
