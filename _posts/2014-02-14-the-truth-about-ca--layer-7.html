<p>Has it really been almost a year since my last post?I suspected I was near that milestone but it’s still surprising to discover it has been so long.The story of the last year, of course, is the acquisition of Layer 7 by CA Technologies.Today being Valentine’s Day, I’m reminded that acquisitions are very much like relationships and I’ve been completely consumed with making this one a success.So, the last year is a blur of integration, customer outreach and some terrific innovations — but not a lot of writing.</p>
