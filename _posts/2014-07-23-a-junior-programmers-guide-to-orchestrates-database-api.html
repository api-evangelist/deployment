<p>As a new junior developer, many of my friends and colleagues have given me advice about the craft of coding.One of the best pieces of advice I’ve received is to “build something every day, no matter what.” It’s not about what you build, but rather how you think, my mentors tell me.Solving problems regularly keeps your brain active and ready to attack when you are stumped on a real function within a project.I decided to get started with Orchestrate to see how it could help with rapid building.</p>
