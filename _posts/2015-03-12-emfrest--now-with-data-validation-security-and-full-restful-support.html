<p>Weâ€™re glad to announce the release of the new version of EMF-REST with better performance and new features.Hamza gives us an overview.EMF REST takes EMF models as input and generates Web APIs following the REST principles and relying on well-known libraries and standards, thus facilitating its comprehension and maintainability.EMF-REST aims at bringing more agility to the Web development process by providing ready-to-run-and-test Web APIs out of data models.For MDE practitioners, this approach provides the basis to develop model-based solutions relying on the Cloud as well as an enhanced collaborative support for Web-based modeling tools.</p>
