<p>This article can be considered a supplementary document for sails.org documentation in using sails.Assuming we are good with sails and nodejs, lets jump into datalayer and creation of an API in sails
We will create the database and then model it on sails.It is a personal preference to define the database and then model the entities in code, While the reverse is also interesting, I am not sure sails has tools to update /create database objects based on model changes.like a PHP LaRavel or a Microsoft Entity Framework -> code-First.</p>
