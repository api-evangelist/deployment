<p>In my previous blog post, I examined the problem of REST API complexity in the enterprise.In short, as a company builds more and more web services, the situation server-side becomes increasingly complex, which can reduce portability, scalability, efficiency, and security.It also slows down development, just at a time when enterprises are scaling up development of mobile applications.In this blog post, I discuss some of the solutions that companies use to address this problem, and assess their effectiveness.It starts innocently enough: someone needs to build a new enterprise application that requires web services.</p>
