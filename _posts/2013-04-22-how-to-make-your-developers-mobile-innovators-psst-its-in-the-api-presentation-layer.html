<p>APIs have multiple purposes inside an enterprise.Most of the early excitement around API stemmed from the potential for APIs to foster communities of “long-tail” developers.With data becoming the new mobile currency, opening up data to legions of developers held out the promise of multiplying revenue and reach for start-ups and enterprises alike.While several start-ups have demonstrated the potential of tapping the long-tail developer community (look at examples like Twillio, Tapjoy, Stripe and Braintree) the number of enterprises that have seen similar success is less clear (Amazon Web Services is an obvious counterpoint).One reason for this is simple – enterprises have conflicting interests and are almost never set up to successfully service these communities at all costs.</p>
