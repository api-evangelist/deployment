<p>Logging has been used since the most primitive software days as a form of event storage abstraction.Obviously, system and application level logging have matured over the years.Application logs now usually store records of application events like request details, response codes, and triage constructs like unstructured errors messages or stack traces.Logging frameworks like log4j in the Java world and utilities like syslog have made it easier to control logging levels, history (rollovers) and make application behavior human readable (short for text).Logs are still core to debugging or analytics regardless of the automation and tooling built over them.</p>
