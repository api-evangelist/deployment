<p>Facebook said Wednesday that it’s open sourcing a new software framework called Proxygen that’s comprised of C++ HTTP libraries and a web server.The company says Proxygen will make it faster to build new features and roll them out into production environments.Originally conceived in 2011 as a software library that could build out proxy servers, which act like intermediary points between an end user and a server, the project morphed into a bigger framework that lets Facebook use newer web-performance features in its infrastructure that other software frameworks can’t really handle without significant modifications.For example, Facebook can use new software-performance enhancers like the Google-developed SPDY protocol for faster load times and increased security; TLS false start to boost the speed of SSL security exchanges; and specialized Facebook load-scheduling algorithms.Proxygen can also easily integrate with Facebook’s many different infrastructure services, scales nicely and has a reusable codebase that helps the company harness the latest web technology like HTTP/2, the next-generation version of the HTTP web protocol.</p>
