<p>Disclaimer: This post is about the Java micro web framework named Spark and not about the data processing engine Apache Spark.In this blog post we will see how Spark can be used to build a simple web service.As mentioned in the disclaimer, Spark is a micro web framework for Java inspired by the Ruby framework Sinatra.Spark aims for simplicity and provides only a minimal set of features.However, it provides everything needed to build a web application in a few lines of Java code.</p>
