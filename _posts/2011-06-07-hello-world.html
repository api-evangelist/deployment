<p>I find it easier to get to grips with products when I use them, tool tips and “tip of the day” splash screens bug me, I actually prefer meaningful error messages when I mess things up.With that in mind I’m not going to go through each and every facet of what you can see in the design tool you just fired up I’m just going to walk through a simple example… which will educate as well as stimulate some questions….Having said that, it is helpful to know which end of the proverbial oar to use before starting to paddle so here is the express tour of the main Policy Studio design window.Selecting the different sections on the bottom left hand container changes the explorer tree node view.left clicking on any of the node items changes the contents of the tabbed central panel to a context sensitive display 
If you are anything like me then you’ll probably have tried clicking, double clicking and right clicking on just about everything that looks clickable by now (I’m every IT trainers worst nightmare).</p>
