<p>At this week’s Computers, Freedom & Privacy Conference, I gave a presentation titled Jailbreak Your APIs, in which I explored the concept of “linked APIs” and explained the potential these interfaces have for helping us create a freer, more open world.The global informational overload that we are constantly exposed to, can be overwhelming but ideas like linked APIs help us remember that the explosive surge of available data also brings us beautiful things such as transparency, openness and an unprecedented feeling of global connectedness.We’ve never felt more connected to the rest of the world than we do now.Computers, mobile devices and the Internet have brought us closer than ever before.We now take it for granted that a person can be pretty much anywhere in the world and still get a real-time, front-row view of breaking news from half-way around the globe.</p>
