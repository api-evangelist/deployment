<p>I often hear the term “ROI” used in reference to an API program.Often, it is the discussed in the context of getting either direct revenue from an API or growing reach from an API, which in some places, translates into a lower cost of customer acquisition.While both direct revenue and reach are admirable goals, ROI from an API program is not limited to the number and quality of external developers.For instance, most organizations will derive far more immediate payback from an API initiative if it enables internal developers, enterprise mobility initiatives, tighter partner integrations or even IT rationalization through hybrid cloud.Each of these endeavours will pay dividends in terms of productivity, agility, distribution and lowered IT costs.</p>
