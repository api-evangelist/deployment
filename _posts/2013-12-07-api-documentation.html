<p>Software companies, such as Microsoft, create documentation for millions of topics concerning its APIs, services, and software platforms (MSDN).Creating this documentation comes at a considerable cost and effort.And after all this effort much documentation is rarely consulted (Lethbridge).API documentation is especially difficult to create (Robillard): as just a few writers must create documentation that teaches concepts and that maximally covers the many ways the thousands to millions of developers may be using their API.Now, the trend may shift even more of the undocumented burden onto developers.</p>
