<p>The API Academy team has a new member: Irakli Nadareishvili who has joined CA Layer 7 as Director of API Strategy.Â Before joining CA, Irakli served as Director of Engineering for Digital Media at NPR, which is noted for its leadership in API-oriented platform design.He has also participated in the creation of the Public Media Platform, worked with whitehouse.gov and helped a number of major media companies develop publishing solutions using open source software.I recently sat down with Irakli to discuss what he has in mind as he joins API Academy.</p>
