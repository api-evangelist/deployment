<p>Maven is the most popular build and deployment automation tool in the enterprise world.It has become the de facto tool for automated building, deploying, and testing of large multi-module and multi-team enterprise application development environments.There are hundreds of Maven plug-ins for all kinds of software development life cycle (SDLC) jobs for IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic, and more.Maven is well-understood by developers and administrators for continuous integration, as serious production deployments favor scripts over GUI to deploy code.So weâ€™re excited to announce the general availability of a Maven plugin for Apigee API proxy deployment as an open source tool.</p>
