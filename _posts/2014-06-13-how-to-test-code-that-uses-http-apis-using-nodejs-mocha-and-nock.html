<p>One of the challenges of using a database like Orchestrate, is not having a local running instance of the datastore to write tests against.However, when you’re testing you do not want to test the database or the APIs that your code relies on.The goal should be to test your code, because… 
In March, we showed you how to test HTTP APIs using Python and VCR, but this time I want to show off using Mocha and Nock to automate API testing in Node.js projects.Mocha is a testing framework for Node.</p>
