<p>Zend recently announced its plans to rework the middleware framework on which its Web application framework resides to enable developers invoking APIs to build faster applications.Zend Framework 3, due out in the third quarter, will be based on a lighter weight, high-performance alternative to existing Model-View Controller (MVC) frameworks.As part of that effort, Zend CEO Andi Gutmans says Apigility API Builder from Zend will be delivered on top of the new middleware stack.Zend, explains Gutmans, will continue to support the MVC framework for some time to come.But for applications that invoke APIs, Gutmans promises the new middleware stack will provide much higher levels of performance â€” especially for mobile computing applications built using PHP.</p>
