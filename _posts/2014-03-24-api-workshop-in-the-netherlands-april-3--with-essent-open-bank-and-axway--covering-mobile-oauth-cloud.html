<p>Following our recent API Workshops in Australia and New Zealand, the next port of call is The Netherlands, where we are running an API Workshop on April 3 in Utrecht.For people who havent been to an API Workshop, heres a quick description of the format: Its a half-day event, beginning with presentations by real live API practitioners speaking about the experiences.Following these presentations and Q&A, we then look at the technology behind APIs.At the Netherlands event, Im very pleased to say that we have two great speakers lined up: Firstly there is Simon Redfern from the Open Bank Project.Ive followed the innovative work of the Open Bank Project for a while now.</p>
