<p>SOA Software recently published a new whitepaper entitled “SOA and API Convergence: What it Means for IBM Customers” that offers some engaging ideas on the future relationship between SOA and API technology.The whitepaper gives IBM customers some solid architectural ideas founded on the SOA and API strength of the IBM DataPower gateway partnered with SOA Software, but even more importantly on the premise that unification of SOA and API technology is the only sound direction available to the enterprise.That paper did a good job making its case for a unified SOA and API convergence so I won’t repeat any of those details here.Instead, I wanted to take a look at the other side of the coin.What if we made the case for anything other than SOA and API unification in the enterprise?</p>
