<p>Today we are introducing the Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM) algorithm for Swift Predictions.FPM, similarly to Apriori, is part of that group of algorithms considered unsupervised learning.They are the most common algorithms for discovering frequently co-occurring items in large datasets.For example, discovering which products are frequently bought together in a supermarket, or how some products can influence the sale of other products.Â 
Apriori is known to have computation limitations when the dataset is large.</p>
