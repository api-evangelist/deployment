<p>The Axway API Gateway, as the name suggests, is often used as a gateway in front of APIs / Web Services.The connection to the API behind the API Gateway often is over SSL.If this connection uses a self-signed certificate (i.e.not VeriSign or another global CA), then how do you configure the trust for this connection?</p>
