<p>A quick intro: I’m Bill Oakes, I work in product marketing for CA Layer 7 and I was recently elected to write a regular blog about the business of APIs.I’ve been around the block over the years – a coder, an engineer… I even wrote a BBS once upon a time (yes, I’m pre-Web, truly a dinosaur – roar!) But now I “market things”.That said, I still have a bit of geek left in me and with that in mind, this blog is going to focus not so much on the “what” or “how” when it comes to APIs, their implementations and how they affect businesses/consumers but rather, the “why” (which means, alas, I won’t be writing about the solar-powered bikini or the Zune anytime soon – I mean, really… why?)
For an initial first post, I thought I’d take a look at the Internet of Things (IoT) because it’s something no one else is really discussing today (cough).</p>
