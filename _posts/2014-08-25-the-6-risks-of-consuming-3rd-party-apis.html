<p>There is so much focus for companies to externalize their services via APIs, that there is little to no focus for how these same companies are consuming 3rd Party APIs.  This is gearing up to be or already is a major issue for the enterprise.   Most of the companies I have talked to about exposing their APIs,  say they are not managing the consumption of the 3rd party APIs that they are consuming at this point and it is getting to be a big issue that is costing them a lot of money.    Right now in the industry, I compare this to the toothache my son had but didn’t tell me about, or didn’t know he should tell me about it.   He was in some pain, but there were enough distractions and his fear of the dentist was so great that he figured he could just ignore it.</p>
