<p>If you have visited Bloomberg’s website lately you may have noticed a new tool called Bloomberg Industry Leaderboard, which is a part of their Visual Data site.The Leaderboard presents fundamental data about 600 leading global corporations in a visually attractive manner.Visualization techniques such as tree map, colored grid and rankings are all dynamically configurable, and results are sorted on the fly.While the concept of presenting fundamental metrics in similar ways is not new, and there are many websites with similar data and visualization, the technical details behind the site are worth examining a bit closer. Traditionally, data-driven  web pages respond to users input (clicks) by requesting from the web server a fully prepared page, coded in HTML for the browser to render.</p>
