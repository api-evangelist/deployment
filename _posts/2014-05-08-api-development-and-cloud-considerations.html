<p>There used to be armies of developers who defined themselves as “integration experts”; they were tasked with doing the hands-on work of IT bartending.In essence, they had to blend different applications together so they produced a result that was greater than the sum of their parts.There were the old guards who dealt in Oracle databases and connected data stored within HR, manufacturing and CRM applications.More recently, developers look to integrate with better use of APIs so they can mashup Google maps with consumer shopping apps.There is a distinction now (and whether or not it is an advantage remains to be seen) between traditional apps and those that reside and operate in the cloud.</p>
