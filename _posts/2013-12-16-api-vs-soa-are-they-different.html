<p>There has been a lot of talk about APIs vs.SOA, and there is still a lot of confusion about whether APIs are different or similar to SOA.The needle keeps swinging from one side to another, with API purists trying to detach themselves completely from SOA and the SOA die-hards claiming that APIs are just an extension of SOA.From the perspective of SOA Software, having served hundreds of Fortune 1000 customers that are either using our products for only SOA,  APIs and a growing number that are now using for both, the real answer is probably somewhere in the middle.  APIs share essentially all of the basic architectural principals as SOA.</p>
