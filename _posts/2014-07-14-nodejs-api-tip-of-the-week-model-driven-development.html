<p>Today we kick off a new “Tip of the Week” blog series focusing on APIs.Which just so happens to be the primary use case for Node.js! APIs are driving the new frontedge – inclusive of mobile, tablets, wearables, web browsers, sensors, et al by providing rich backend data access in a flexible interface.These APIs are being increasingly generated using API frameworks, which act as “super glue” tying together the endpoints of disparate enterprise systems and data sources, and then exposing them in a uniform API to all clients.</p>
