<p>Roberto V.Zicari, editor of ODBMS.org has recently published an interview with a practicing data scientist John Goodwin about using semantic web technologies such as RDF to cope with large amount of data in disparate sources.Linked data is great for data integration â€“ a common data language makes it easy (or rather easier) to bring a number of disparate datasets together.It is also more flexible than traditional relational database technologies.</p>
