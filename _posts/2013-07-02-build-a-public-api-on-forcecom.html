<p>Roughly two years ago we wrote our CloudSpokes API on the Force.com platform.It’s evolved of course and the current version is a Ruby application that proxies calls to Force.com via Apex REST Services.Recently we’ve had a number of companies and ISVs come to us asking for advice on how to build a public API for their own Force.</p>
