<p>In a previous blog, we looked at the behavior of scripts that run in applications, and how they need to interact with APIs in order for you to gain full advantage of multiple applications running through a single API.We’re going to look at the phase of development that happens after configuring your API.It is at this stage that you are likely at a point where you have already defined the application elements that will “feed” your API, and you are looking for a way to quickly and efficiently use your API as the hub for inter- and intra-application communication and execution.If you have properly configured your API script, then addressing the reference script is the next step towards executing the application.Let’s look at this a bit more closely: 
After you add your set of utility scripts, in your virtual service operation process definition, you add a Script Activity, import a pre-defined script, and add a script reference for the function you want to perform.</p>
