<p>This article was originally published by Samuel Mendenhall on the Red Hat Developer Blog.Iâ€™ve been involved with full-stack development for a while now, especially stacks involving single page apps.When choosing to go with a single page webapp the backend concerns change.While any backend will do the job (think ruby, python, java, etc.) more emphasis is placed on the front-end stack as most of the time is spent in Javascript and less in the backend language since that is not where the UI logic resides.</p>
