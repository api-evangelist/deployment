<p>Inspired by a conversation with Kin Lane and Mike Amundsen at last year’s APIdays conference in Paris, I decided to dig deeper into the SDK-vs-API debate.As I wrote in my last post, I had noticed a pattern of using API SDKs rather than the underlying Web APIs.Let’s quickly define what I mean by SDK.There used to be a time, not so long ago, when “SDK” meant documentation, code samples, build scripts and libraries all bundled together.Today, you find all the former on the Web and usually only the library remains.</p>
