<p>When you ask for an API, you will get one, even though you never needed it.Really, nobody takes your website serious anymore if you don’t offer an API.And that’s what everybody did: they got themselves a nice API.An enormous amount of money and energy is wasted on developing APIs that are hard to create and even harder to use.This is wonderful news for developers, who get paid to build two pieces of software—a server and a client—that were actually never needed in the first place.</p>
