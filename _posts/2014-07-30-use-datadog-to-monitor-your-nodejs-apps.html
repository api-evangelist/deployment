<p>We heard your feedback and took action on it by exposing an API that gives you access to data collected by the StrongLoop monitoring agent.So, what does this mean for you?You can now access performance metrics data without using our StrongOps console.Along with the API, we wrote strong-agent middleware for publishing metrics via the well-known StatsD protocol.As you know, the StatsD protocol is supported by a large ecosystem of servers and plugins, allowing publishing into custom infrastructure.</p>
