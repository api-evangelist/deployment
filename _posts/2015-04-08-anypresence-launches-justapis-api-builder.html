<p>MBaaS enterprise provider AnyPresence today has released a new product, JustAPIs, aimed at helping developers within the enterprise to quickly build new APIs.The API entry-level service is also suited to independent developers who want to get an API up and running quickly, says Richard Mendis, chief marketing and product officer at AnyPresence.“When we are out there selling our MBaaS solution, we often run across app developers who need to build a few  RESTful  APIs for their apps,” says Mendis.He says these are app developers working behind the corporate firewall who want to test a solution, connect a data set via API into an existing app, use a RESTful API as a proxy access to a SOAP legacy system or create APIs to build a prototype app.“At the moment they have three options,” says Mendis.</p>
