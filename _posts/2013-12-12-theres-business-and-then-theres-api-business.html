	    				    					Your business, while certainly complex in its operations and delivery, runs on pretty much the same principles that all businesses run on.You have a product (which could be a hard good, soft good, or a service) that you try to optimize for customers (product strategy, engineering, development), communicate to customers (marketing), and sell to customers (sales, or, the guys who drive AUDIs).Along the way, you make sure bills are paid, customers are serviced, and that the proverbial trains run on time.</p>
