<p>‘Events’ associate time-ordered data with key/value objects.They power audit trails, logs, and timelines – Orchestrate.io (http://orchestrate.io/docs/events)  
The above statement is straight from Orchestrate’s dev resources, but let’s see events in action.I wanted to explore how to use events, so I built annonforum, a forum where all posts and comments are anonymous.</p>
