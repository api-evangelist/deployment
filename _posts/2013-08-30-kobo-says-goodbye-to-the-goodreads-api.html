<p>An API-related news item that caught my interest earlier today speaks volumes about the nature of the burgeoning API market.Kobo  (a seller of eBook readers), has decided to stop using the open book recommendation and review API provided by Goodreads.The reason? The social site for avid readers was acquired a few months ago by Amazon, which just happens to lead the eBook reader market with its Kindle product.Acquisitions impacting business partnerships isn’t a new concept.</p>
