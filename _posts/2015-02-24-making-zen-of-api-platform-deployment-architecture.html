<p>The general guiding principles of the Zen philosophy can actually be quite helpful in designing the Anypoint Platform for APIs‘ deployment architecture.The emphasis on having a holistic approach, while striving for simplicity, symmetry, and minimalism, works as well for meditation as for coming up with a stable, robust and secure architecture.Here, we will outline the four most common models in use today that dovetail with the teachings of the Zen philosophy.The first model is a pure on-premises configuration.In this case we generally recommend setting up the API Gateway cluster inside the DMZ to run the API proxy applications, with communication to the gateway restricted to only between the API Web management console, the Mule Management Console, and the service implementations themselves via another firewall and load balancer.</p>
