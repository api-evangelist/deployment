<p>Back in 2011, Marc Andreessen famously stated that “software is eating the world” and predicted that – over the subsequent decade – almost every major industry would be disrupted and transformed by software and the innovations of Silicon Valley.Just over two years later, it’s pretty clear he was right on the money.In order to remain relevant, many industrial behemoths need to transform themselves and they are looking at the software revolution as a way to enable a fresh wave of innovation and development.This revolution has never been more important to the telco world, where it must start at the very core of the organization.Every layer – from network, to infrastructure, to application – should be considered a service enabler, be defined in software and be driven by APIs.</p>
