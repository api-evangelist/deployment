<p>When I build an API, I like to have it as light-weight and scalable as possible.At the same time, I want to be able to easily add or remove features with the least amount of effort possible.Because Node.JS and Express give control over the inner workings of a web application, they are the perfect fit.We will build a RESTful API for a library.</p>
