<p>The version of APISpark we just deployed introduces a new feature to accelerate the creation of APIs: the Quickstart Wizard.This neat new wizard provides step-by-step guidance for the most common tasks APISpark users perform.Wizard options include:
Create an API: in just a couple clicks, you will create a REST API to expose data, its associated data store (in the form of an Entity Store), and all the proper links between the Entity Store and the Web API.Manage an API: through the wizard, you can connect to an existing API, import its Swagger description, and setup authentication (who can call the API), authorization (what the user has access to), firewall protection (rate limitation, IP filtering) and analytics on usage.But there is more.</p>
